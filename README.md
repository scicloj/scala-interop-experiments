# scala-interop-experiments

Here we are experimenting with Clojure<->Scala interop using [from-scala](https://t6.github.io/from-scala/).

Our first goal is to wrap [Rainier](https://github.com/stripe/rainier). The first step would be to have all the little [examples](https://github.com/stripe/rainier/tree/develop/rainier-example/src/main/scala/com/stripe/rainier/example) working. Then, we will reflect and try to make things more idiomatic.
